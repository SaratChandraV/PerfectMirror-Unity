# PerfectMirror-Unity
Modified mirror reflection in unity for physical mirror resemblance. This is a modified version of mirrorreflection.cs from unity wiki

To make this script work attach the script to gameobject. (The gameobject's transform up i.e, local y-axis orientation is taken as normal to plane mirror.). Then create a material with Mirror shader and add your texture with alpha channel as maintex that controls where the reflection should be.
